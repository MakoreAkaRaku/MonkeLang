# MonkeLang

/*Brief explanation of inspirational backstory*/

<p>MonkeLang is an abbreviation of Monkey Language, a simple compiler made as a final project for 'Compilers' subject back at the Balearic University.
The principal purpose of this language is to be easy-to-read and make much more understandable code without adding to much verbose (trying to avoid similarity to python from here).</p>

> Monkeys do not speak, yet they understand each other by body expression, so why don't formally declare a language based on them, leading beginners on programming to a more understandable interaction between a program and a computer?
